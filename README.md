   a) Print the total number of employees in the company.
   b) Print the total number of departments in the company'
   c) Print the department names of the company
   d) Print the total number of employees in each department
   e) Print the total number of employees in each state
   f) Print the total number of employees in each state in each department
   g) Print the minimum and maximum salaries in each department and sort salaries in ascending order
   h) Print the names of employees working in NT state under finance department whose bonuses are greater than the average bonuses of employees in NY state
   i) Raise the salaries $500 of all employees whose age is greater than 45
   j) Create DataFrame of all those employees whose age is greater than 45 and save them in a file.
